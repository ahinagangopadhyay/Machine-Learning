## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each dedicated to a specific machine learning algorithm:

* `Conditional Random Fields/`
* `Decision Trees/`
* `Expectation-Maximization/`
* `Naive Bayes Classifier/`
* `Random Forests/`
* `Support Vector Machines/`

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook
* Essential Python libraries:

  * `numpy`
  * `pandas`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `scikit-learn`


## üìö Algorithms Covered

* **Conditional Random Fields (CRF):** A statistical modeling method used for structured prediction, commonly applied in natural language processing tasks like POS tagging and named entity recognition.

* **Decision Trees:** A flowchart-like tree structure where internal nodes represent tests on features, branches represent outcomes, and leaf nodes represent class labels or regression values.

* **Expectation-Maximization (EM):** An iterative algorithm used for finding maximum likelihood estimates in models with latent variables, often applied in clustering and density estimation.

* **Naive Bayes Classifier:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of feature independence, effective in text classification and spam detection.

* **Random Forests:** An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks.

* **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A supervised learning model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data into classes, effective in high-dimensional spaces.
