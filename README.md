## üìö Algorithms Covered

### Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
A statistical modeling method used for structured prediction, commonly applied in NLP tasks like POS tagging and named entity recognition.

### Decision Trees
A flowchart-like tree structure where internal nodes test features, branches represent outcomes, and leaf nodes give class labels or regression values.

### Expectation-Maximization (EM)
An iterative algorithm to find maximum likelihood estimates in models with latent variables, often used in clustering and density estimation.

### Naive Bayes Classifier
A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem assuming feature independence, effective in text classification and spam detection.

### Random Forests
An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and outputs the majority class for classification.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
A supervised model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data into classes, effective in high-dimensional spaces.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
A deep learning architecture designed to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, widely used in computer vision.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
A neural network designed for sequential data where connections form cycles to maintain memory of previous inputs.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
A specialized RNN that uses gates to capture long-range dependencies and overcome vanishing gradients in sequence modeling.
